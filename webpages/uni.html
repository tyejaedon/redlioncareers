    <h3>Crucial Factors When Deciding The Right College!</h3>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>The Major!</li>
        <div class = 'content'>
        <p >
            
            It is important that you take into consideration the amount of majors
            
            offered by the college that align with your intrests and career path.
       
            Not always will you be able to enroll in your first choice major 
       
            and your fallback might be your future career.
        </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <li>Cost and Fees!</li>

        <div class = 'content'>
        <p >
            
            The sticker price on most schools is not usually what a student will pay, 
            especially regarding private colleges. Ask about financial aid and scholarship opportunities 
            at the colleges or universities you are interested in. There are also many local scholarships 
            and renewable scholarships available.
        </p>
    </div>

    <li>Class size!</li>

        <div class = 'content'>
        <p >
            5000, 10000, 30000 ...these are examples of the number of students typical colleges have.
             Class size can have a big impact on learning due to the sharing of resources and other factors.
            There is a huge disparity between small discussion-based classes and big lectures requiring multiple of teaching assistants.
            Depending on which learning style you resonate with a large or small college can make your learning enjoyable.


        </p>
    </div>

    <li>Academic Support and Career Services</li>

    <div class = 'content'>
    <p >
        What kind of education you will receive greatly depends on how a college supports students with their academics.
         While other schools provide possibilities like free tutoring groups and writing assistance, 
         some schools provide little support and strive to promote an environment of independence.
          Knowing the school's placement rates for employment 
          and graduate programs is also important to take into account because it provides information 
          about the effectiveness and breadth of each program.

    </p>
</div>


<li>Perspective</li>

    <div class = 'content'>
    <p >
        How a college made you feel is the most crucial consideration while choosing one. 
        The school you choose should feel like home, 
        a place where you can grow and develop not only academically but in all facets of life, 
        regardless of all the programs, opportunities, and scholarships. 
        By giving you the skills you'll need for the rest of your life, 
        the proper institution will cultivate an environment 
        that will both challenge you and assist you in realizing your objectives and goals.
