<p class = 'write'>
    - The CSS Profile is an online application used by colleges and scholarship programs to award non-federal institutional aid.
<br>
<br>
    - The CSS Profile opens the door to nonfederal scholarships and 
    other types of institutional help that may make a significant difference when it comes to paying for college.
     It is maintained and overseen by the College Board, the same organization that creates the SAT.
<br>
<br>
- The CSS Profile provides options for families to explain any special or mitigating circumstances that influence 
their capacity to pay, with the goal of providing a more complete picture of a family's financial situation 
than the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA.

    <h1 class = 'title'>FAFSA: Free Application for Federal Student Aid </h1>
    <br>

    <p class = 'write'>
        - To apply for any federal financial aid to help you pay for college, you must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The U.S. Department of Education awards more than 13 million students who fill out the FAFSA each year more than $120 billion in scholarships, work-study, and low-interest loans.
<br>
<br>
- The FAFSA is also used by many states and institutions to decide whether students receive financial help and how much they will receive.
<br>
<br>
- You might need your parents' assistance to complete the FAFSA because it requests details about your finances and those of your family, including tax records. Contact your school counselor if you require further assistance.
    </p>

      
<h1 class = 'title color'>What you will need!</h1>
