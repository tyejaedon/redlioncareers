    <br>
    <p class = 'content'>
        The PSAT, or Preliminary SAT, is a standardized test administered by the College Board that serves as a practice test for the SAT, which is one of the most widely used college admissions tests in the United States.

        Taking the PSAT as a sophomore or junior can be beneficial in several ways. First, it provides a baseline score for the SAT, which can help you identify areas in which you need to improve before taking the actual SAT. Second, the PSAT can qualify you for National Merit Scholarship programs, which can provide significant financial assistance for college. Finally, the PSAT can help you get a feel for what it's like to take a standardized test, which can reduce anxiety and help you perform better on the actual SAT.
        
        In addition to the benefits mentioned above, taking the PSAT can also help you prepare for other standardized tests you may need to take in the future, such as the ACT or AP exams. Overall, taking the PSAT can be a valuable experience for high school students who are planning to attend college.

    <br>
    <p class = 'content'>

    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>College admissions: Many colleges and universities in the United States accept both ACT and SAT scores as part of their application process. Taking the ACT can increase your options for colleges to apply to and give you a better chance of getting accepted.</li>

        <li>USubject matter testing: The ACT is designed to assess your knowledge and skills in specific subject areas, such as English, math, science, and reading. If you feel particularly strong in any of these areas, taking the ACT may provide an opportunity to demonstrate your proficiency and stand out to colleges.</li>
        <li>Personal preference: Some students may find that they perform better on the ACT than the SAT, or simply prefer the format and structure of the ACT. Taking both tests and comparing scores can help you determine which test is the best fit for you.
