            When a student is enrolled in both high school 
            and a higher education institution, 
            they are said to be in dual enrollment. 
            Students have the chance to finish college-level material 
            and receive college credits when they enroll in dual enrollment.
             In addition to offering challenging courses, dual enrollment introduces 
             students to college life and expectations and helps them get ready for them. 
             These programs offer students a quicker and more cost-effective method to complete 
             their college degrees.
