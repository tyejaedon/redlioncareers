    <p class = 'write'>
        A merit scholarship is one that is given to students with a track record of success in their academics (including grades and test scores), extracurricular activities, and community leadership.

        Certain schools and institutions, as well as non-profit groups, may provide these scholarships.
        
        Merit scholarships, in contrast to need-based financial assistance, do not consider a student's financial need as determined by the FAFSA or CSS Profile. Rather, they are exclusively based on a student's academic performance.
        
        Each organization will have a different set of standards for merit scholarships. Most merit scholarships, however, will evaluate applicants based on the following criteria:
            High school transcript detailing grades and the difficulty of your classes

<h3>Need-Based Scholarships</h3>

<p class = 'write'>
    Scholarships that are need-based are given to students who qualify. They are qualified to enroll in college each year. Scholarships based on merit, on the other hand, are given to students who exhibit excellence in academics or athletics along with a variety of other skills and requirements.
</p>
<h3>How do I apply for a need-based scholarship?</h3>
<p class = 'write'>
    Begin by filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), the most commonly used form for applying for a need-based scholarship. FAFSA applications open October 1, and students who apply early have a higher likelihood of receiving aid as funds are administered on a first-come, first-serve basis.
