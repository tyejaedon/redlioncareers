       Application Portals 
       
       will be your bread and butter.

    <br>
    <p class = 'content'>
        Every college candidate's essential personal information can be found in the applicant portal. A college applicant can often do the following after signing in to the application portal:
      
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Update contact information including mailing address, email address, and phone number</li>
        <li>Monitor the status of his or her application</li>
        <li>Track the submission and receipt of required documents</li>
        <li>Upload additional documents required for his or her application</li>
        <li>View the decision on the application (and perhaps even the financial aid offer)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class = 'starter'>Application Portal To Use For Applying To Colleges</h3>
    <p class = 'content'>
       Application Portals come in all shape and size unlike the ones in Portal 2. 
       When applying the choice of portal may not affect your admission but will certainly make your life much easier.
       Although you do have an option using the college's own portal, when applying to various schools it may prove diffcult to keep track 
    of all of the Universities. 
       Here is a snippet of application portals that will provide a streamlined process and are suitable for studying in the US and other countries abroad.
